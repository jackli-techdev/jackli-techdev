Hi Everyone! 👋🏻

I'm a JackLi, Full Stack Developer - IEEE UET Lahore & Planning Committee at AWS Community aimed at developing communities and empowering the youth.

I've worked as Front-end & Back-end developer for the past 2 years and now transitioning towards Cloud/DevOps Engineering. Meanwhile I'm also a freelancer doing various projects in Ai/ML. 🚀☁️

In addition to this, having a product oriented mindset I've won & arranged multiple Hackathons introducing innovative products and further providing assistance to bring new ones into the eco-system 🦾
